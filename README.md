# Why

Brew your own delicious beer recipies!

# Getting started

Just create a new Arduino project, import the Bieromat.ino file and upload it to your board as described here: https://www.instructables.com/id/Import-a-Code-Library-to-Arduino/

As this was my first programming project and I didn't know any standards back then, I have to apologize for using German language throughout the entire code.

# Getting stuffed

To run your own brewing machine you need sensors, an Arduino and other equipment. Here is a list with costs:
- Arduino UNO: 20€
- Temperature sensors, waterproof, cable length min. 1m (DS18B20; I used two of them): 5 - 10€
- Relais 230V: 2€
- 20x4 LCD: 4€
- I2C: 2€
- Transformer 12V, min. 100W: 10 - 15€
- H-bridge: 4€
- Front windscreen wiper motor 12V: go to the scrapyard and you'll usually get it for free
- Stainless steel stirrer with shaft to be connected to your motor (own construction with impeller blades)
- Small parts: 4x digital button, 4x 10kOhm resistance, small board, cable, cable connectors, power switch 230V
