# Why


# Getting started

Just create a new Arduino project, import the Bieromat.ino file and upload it to your board as described here: https://www.instructables.com/id/Import-a-Code-Library-to-Arduino/

# Getting stuffed

To run your own brewing machine you need sensors, an Arduino and other equipment. Here is a list with costs:
- Arduino UNO: 20€
- Temperature sensors, waterproof, cable length min. 1m (DS18B20; I used two of them): 5 - 10€
- Relais 230V: 5€
- 20x4 LCD
- I2C
- Transformer 12V, min. 100W: 
- H-bridge
- Front windscreen wiper motor 12V: go to the scrapyard and you'll usually get it for free
- Stainless steel stirrer with shaft to be connected to your motor (own construction with impeller blades)
- Small parts: 4x digital button, 4x 10kOhm resistance, small board, cable, cable connectors, power switch 230V
